\title{Visualize Mutation Frequency with a Bar Plot}
\usage{
visualizeMutationFrequencyBar(data, group_by_column)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing mutation data, which must include the specified grouping column.}

\item{group_by_column}{A character string specifying the column to group by for mutation frequency counts.
This argument determines how the mutation data will be categorized and displayed in the bar plot.
For instance, if you choose "Chromosome" as the \code{group_by_column}, the function will aggregate and display mutation counts for each chromosome.
Similarly, selecting "SNP_Mutation" would group and visualize mutation frequencies by the different SNP_Mutations. Ensure that the value provided matches exactly one of the column names in the \code{data} data frame.
Examples of valid inputs include "Chromosome", "Reference_Allele", etc. There is no default value for this parameter; it must be explicitly provided by the user based on the available columns in the dataset.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object showing a bar plot with the specified grouping column on the x-axis and
the mutation frequency on the y-axis.
}
\description{
This function generates a bar plot showing the frequency of mutations based on a specified column.
It is ideal for visualizing the distribution of mutations by a single category, such as chromosome or allele type.

\dontrun{

# Example 1
# Visualize mutation frequency by chromosome
visualizeMutationFrequencyBar(UCS.mutations, group_by_column = "Chromosome")

Example 2
