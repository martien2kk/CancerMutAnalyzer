\title{Filter Mutation Data by Specified Conditions}
\usage{
filterMutations(data, conditions)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing mutation data, such as \code{UCS.mutations}.}

\item{conditions}{A list of conditions to filter by, where each element is named with a column name
and contains the value or range to filter on. Example: \code{list(Chromosome = "1", Variant_Type = "SNP")}.}
}
\value{
A filtered data frame that matches the specified conditions.
}
\description{
This function filters mutation data based on user-specified conditions for any columns in the dataset.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Filter by chromosome and variant type
filtered_data <- filterMutations(UCS.mutations, conditions = list(Chromosome = "1", Variant_Type = "SNP"))

# Filter by start position range and a specific gene symbol
filtered_data <- filterMutations(UCS.mutations, conditions = list(Start_position = c(100000, 200000), Hugo_Symbol = "TP53"))
}
